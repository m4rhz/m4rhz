# About Me

Hello, my name is **Muh. Aqil Rajab H** 👋<br />

I am an Informatics student at Telkom University (since 2022) with a passion for **cybersecurity**<br />

I gained practical experience during my **6-month internship at PLN Icon Plus**, where I assisted in planning and implementing network installations and managing security for corporate clients. I also hold the [Google IT Support Professional Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/e21f2c6907c5f2e3cdc12ff6f3ba119a) and have hands-on experience in network and system security.  

Throughout my journey in cybersecurity, I have:
- Participated in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to sharpen my penetration testing skills using tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Nmap.
- Proficiency in programming languages: **Python**, **Bash**, **Golang**, **C**, **C++**, and **Java**.
- Won **1st place in the Network Pioneers Cup** at the Cyvero Cup, showcasing my ability to protect critical infrastructures from cyber threats.

Currently, I am exploring advanced topics in cybersecurity and contributing to innovative projects to safeguard digital ecosystems.  
📚 **Fun Fact:** I'm also a student researcher aiming to collaborate with experts in the field.
